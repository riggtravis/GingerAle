# GingerAle
Ginger Ale is a web application that is targeted at the needs of Berea College ALE program. The ALE program is a set of classes that every student is required to take at least one of. ALE stands for Active Learning Experience. Active Learning Experience courses see students working with partners from the community around Berea, and are frequently focused on public service. Currently, there is no unified or consistent method for professors to handle these classes, and they are expected to come up with their own solutions to the problems of finding how students are performing for partners.
